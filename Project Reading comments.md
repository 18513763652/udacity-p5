1.Players acould move to the river.

2.Allow the palyers to avoid the crash with bugs.

<br>2.Objects: Bugs and players

<br>3.Enviroments: River and grass land

### divide it into code perspective:

Whloe project is composed with CSS file, JS file , index.html file, Read.md 4 files, 
app.js will utilize JS feature to build:

--Bugs and player object builiding
--bugs's moving and player's moving
--all animation feature is achieved in Canvas

1.You will be given a initial  project, and utilze the JS language to achive certian game functions.
<br>Classic Arcade Game Clone Project
<br>https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

2. Then you need to move to app.js file to understand the JS code file structure.

Thoughts Area:
Once the project is loading, the resources.js will cache  image sources, and project features is achieved in 
app.js, and engine.js repeats this process. all images resources could be found in images,Css doesn't perform alot 
in this projec.
